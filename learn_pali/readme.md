# Learn Pali Trainer
Goal is to refresh my knowledge of beginner C usage by using a text file source to feed data to a program that helps you learn
the Pali language by asking a user to provide input for english translations of nouns, verbs, and sentences presented to the user. 

## Goals 
1. Take in the text of a .txt file.
2. Parse the .txt file to create a bank of nouns, verbs, and sentences in pali with their corresponding correct translations. 
3. Present user with random nouns, verbs, and sentences to input english translations.
4. Let the user know if their answer is correct or not. If incorrect, provide the correct answer.
5. Run for 10 questions and then provide a percentage score.
6. Bonus: take soft/approximate inputs that aren't exactly like the memory bank answers as correct.
